# Explain Code Command

## Overview

Provide comprehensive, AI-powered explanations of code segments, functions, classes, or entire files. This command combines natural language explanations with visual diagrams to help developers understand complex code quickly and thoroughly.

## Parameters

### Target (Required)

- `[function-name]` - Specific function to explain
- `[class-name]` - Entire class explanation
- `[file-path]` - Explain entire file
- `[line-range]` - Explain specific lines (e.g., "125-150")
- `current-selection` - Explain currently selected code in IDE

The command automatically:

- Includes visual diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams)
- Uses intermediate complexity level (technical but accessible)
- Provides full context (includes dependencies and related components)
- Saves explanations to `.code-captain/explanations/` for future reference

## Examples

```
# Explain a specific function
/explain-code calculateUserDiscount

# Explain a class
/explain-code PaymentProcessor

# Explain entire file
/explain-code src/auth/AuthService.js

# Explain specific line range
/explain-code "src/utils/helpers.js:45-78"

# Explain currently selected code in IDE
/explain-code current-selection
```

## Output Structure

All explanations are displayed in chat and automatically saved to `.code-captain/explanations/`

## File Organization

Saved explanations are stored with date prefixes for chronological organization:

```
.code-captain/
└── explanations/
    ├── 2024-01-15-AuthenticationFlow.md
    ├── 2024-01-16-PaymentProcessor.md
    ├── 2024-01-16-UserService.md
    └── 2024-01-17-SearchAlgorithm.md
```

Files are named using the format: `[DATE]-[target-name].md` where DATE is YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Auto-Save Behavior

All explanations are automatically saved to `.code-captain/explanations/` using the format `[DATE]-[target-name].md`.

Get current date by running: `npx @devobsessed/code-captain date`

**Example filename:** `.code-captain/explanations/2025-09-27-AuthenticationFlow.md`

## Integration Points

### With Other Commands

```
# Saved explanations can be referenced by other commands
/research authentication
/create-spec payment-processing
/execute-task "optimize the user search"

# AI can access saved explanations from .code-captain/explanations/
# to provide better context for other commands
```

### With IDE Integration

- Hover over function calls to see saved explanations
- Right-click context menu: "Explain with Code Captain"
- Inline explanation widgets for complex code blocks

## Management Commands

```
# List all saved explanations
/list-explanations

# Search explanations
/search-explanations "authentication"

# Show explanation history
/explanation-history calculateDiscount

# Update outdated explanations when code changes
/refresh-explanations --check-code-changes
```

## Diagram Types Generated

### Flowcharts

- Control flow through functions
- Decision trees for complex logic
- Error handling paths

### Sequence Diagrams

- Function call sequences
- API interaction flows
- Database transaction flows

### Class Diagrams

- Object relationships
- Inheritance hierarchies
- Dependency structures

### Architecture Diagrams

- Component interactions
- Data flow through system
- Service communication patterns

## Output Characteristics

All explanations use a consistent intermediate technical level that balances accessibility with depth:

- **Technical but accessible**: Explains how the code works with some optimization details
- **Full context**: Always includes related functions, dependencies, and architectural context
- **Visual diagrams**: Every explanation includes appropriate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or class diagrams
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Shows how the code fits in the entire system

## AI Processing Workflow

1. **Code Analysis**: Parse syntax, identify patterns, measure complexity
2. **Context Gathering**: Understand surrounding code and dependencies
3. **Explanation Generation**: Create intermediate-level natural language description
4. **Diagram Creation**: Generate appropriate visual representations (flowcharts, sequence, class diagrams)
5. **Formatting**: Structure output for both chat display and markdown file
6. **Auto-Save**: Save explanation to `.code-captain/explanations/` with date-prefixed filename `[DATE]-[target-name].md`

## Tool Integration

**Primary tools:**

- `codebase` - Analyzing code structure and dependencies
- `search` - Finding related components and existing explanations
- `editFiles` - Creating explanation documents
- `runCommands` - Date determination and directory creation
- `usages` - Understanding how code is used throughout the system

**Documentation organization:**

- Explanations stored in `.code-captain/explanations/`
- Date-prefixed filenames for chronological organization
- Cross-references to related explanations and components

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

- **Code not found**: "Could not locate [target]. Please check the path/name."
- **Too complex**: "This code is very complex. Consider breaking into smaller explanations."
- **Limited context**: "Some context may be missing. Ensure related files are accessible."

### Fallback Behaviors

- If diagrams fail to generate, provide text-based flow description
- If target is ambiguous, offer multiple options to choose from
- If code is too large, suggest breaking into smaller segments

## Success Metrics

Track effectiveness through:

- Explanation clarity ratings from users
- Frequency of re-explanations for same code
- Time saved in code reviews and onboarding
- Reduction in "what does this do?" questions during development

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Interactive explanations with expandable sections
- Voice-generated explanations for accessibility
- Integration with code review tools
- Automatic explanation updates when code changes
- Explanation versioning and history tracking

### Advanced Capabilities

- Performance profiling integration
- Security vulnerability highlighting in explanations
- Code quality suggestions as part of explanations
- Integration with documentation generation tools
