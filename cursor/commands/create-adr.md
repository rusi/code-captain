# Create ADR Command (create-adr)

## Overview

Create comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that systematically document architectural decisions with clear rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences through a structured analysis and review process.

## When to Use

- Making significant architectural decisions that affect system structure or design
- Documenting technology choices with vendor lock-in or high switching costs
- Recording decisions contrary to team expectations or industry standards
- Capturing complex trade-offs between competing architectural approaches
- Establishing architectural patterns and standards for team consistency
- Onboarding new team members to architectural reasoning and context
- Creating audit trails for compliance and governance requirements

## Prerequisites

**MANDATORY:** This command **automatically executes research** if no relevant research exists. The ADR creation process will:

1. Check for existing research on the decision topic
2. If no research found: **automatically read and execute** the complete research workflow from `.code-captain/commands/research.md`
3. Only proceed with ADR creation after research is completed and documented

## Command Process

### Step 0: Check for Existing Research and Auto-Execute if Missing

**Objective:** Ensure comprehensive research exists before creating ADR - automatically execute research if missing

**Actions:**

1. **Check for existing research:**

   - Use `file_search` to look for related research in `.code-captain/research/` directory
   - Search for research documents that might relate to the architectural decision
   - Use `list_dir` to explore the research directory structure

2. **Automatic research execution if missing:**

   ```
   If no relevant research found:
   "‚ùå No existing research found for this architectural decision.

   Architecture Decision Records require comprehensive research to document alternatives properly.

   üîÑ AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTING RESEARCH WORKFLOW FIRST...

   Reading .code-captain/commands/research.md and executing complete research process..."
   ```

3. **Execute research workflow automatically:**

   - **IMMEDIATELY** use `read_file` to read `.code-captain/commands/research.md`
   - **EXECUTE** the complete 4-phase research methodology as defined in research.md:
     - Phase 1: Define Research Scope
     - Phase 2: Initial Discovery
     - Phase 3: Deep Dive Analysis
     - Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendations
   - **CREATE** research document in `.code-captain/research/{date}-{topic}-research.md`
   - **ONLY CONTINUE** with ADR creation after research is completed

4. **Handle research workflow:**
   - If no research found: **AUTOMATICALLY execute complete research workflow first**
   - If existing research found: Load and reference it throughout the ADR process
   - If research is incomplete: Execute additional research before continuing

**Deliverables:**

- Research availability assessment
- **Completed research documentation** (auto-executed if missing)
- Research document ready for ADR reference

### Step 1: Analyze Decision Context and Current State

**Objective:** Understand the current architectural state and decision context before proceeding

**PREREQUISITE:** This step only begins AFTER Step 0 confirms research exists or completes automatic research execution

**CRITICAL:** If Step 0 executed research automatically, load and reference the newly created research document

**Create todo tracking:**

Use `todo_write` to track the ADR creation process:

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "check-research",
      "content": "Check for existing research and auto-execute if missing",
      "status": "completed"
    },
    {
      "id": "execute-research",
      "content": "Execute complete research workflow (auto-completed if needed)",
      "status": "completed"
    },
    {
      "id": "analyze-context",
      "content": "Analyze decision context and current architectural state",
      "status": "in_progress"
    },
    {
      "id": "define-scope",
      "content": "Define decision scope and evaluation criteria",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "research-alternatives",
      "content": "Research alternatives and evaluate options",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "document-adr",
      "content": "Document ADR with decision rationale",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Actions:**

1. **Understand current architectural patterns:**

   - Use `codebase_search` with queries:
     - "What architectural patterns are currently in use?"
     - "How are similar decisions handled in the codebase?"
     - "What dependencies and integrations exist?"

2. **Find existing ADRs and documentation:**

   - Use `file_search` to find existing ADRs in `.code-captain/decision-records/` directory
   - Use `list_dir` to explore system structure and identify affected components

3. **Gather decision context:**
   - Identify decision stakeholders and their concerns
   - Determine the specific decision that needs to be made and its urgency
   - Document current architectural context summary

**Deliverables:**

- Current architectural context summary
- Decision scope and stakeholder identification
- Existing ADR inventory and numbering

### Step 2: Define Decision Scope and Criteria

**Objective:** Clearly define what decision needs to be made and establish evaluation criteria

**Actions:**

1. **Define the specific architectural decision** requiring documentation

2. **Identify driving forces and constraints:**

   - Business requirements and goals
   - Technical constraints and limitations
   - Performance, security, and scalability requirements
   - Team skills and organizational capabilities
   - Timeline and budget constraints

3. **Establish decision criteria and priorities**

4. **Determine decision maker(s) and approval process**

5. **Set boundaries for the decision scope**

**Deliverables:**

- Clear problem statement
- Decision criteria and evaluation framework
- Stakeholder roles and responsibilities
- Decision timeline and process

### Step 3: Research Alternatives and Evaluate Options

**Objective:** Systematically research and evaluate alternative approaches to the architectural decision

**Research Actions:**

1. **Leverage existing research (if found in Step 0):**

   - Review research documents from `.code-captain/research/` for relevant findings
   - Extract key insights, alternatives, and recommendations from prior research
   - Identify gaps in existing research that need additional investigation

2. **Conduct additional web research as needed:**

   - "[technology/pattern] architectural approaches"
   - "[decision area] best practices"
   - "[technology] vs [alternative] comparison"
   - "[pattern] pros and cons"
   - "[industry/domain] architecture patterns"
   - "[scale] architecture examples"

3. **Use `codebase_search` to understand current implementation approaches**

4. **Identify and document alternative options:**
   - Current state or status quo option
   - Industry standard approaches
   - Innovative or emerging alternatives
   - Hybrid approaches combining multiple patterns

**Evaluation Framework:**

For each alternative, evaluate against established criteria:

- Technical feasibility and complexity
- Performance and scalability implications
- Security and compliance considerations
- Development effort and timeline
- Long-term maintenance and evolution
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive alternatives analysis
- Pros and cons evaluation matrix
- Risk assessment for each option
- Expert opinions and team input summary

### Step 4: Document ADR with Decision Rationale

**Objective:** Create comprehensive ADR documentation with clear decision rationale and consequences

**Preparation Actions:**

1. **Determine current date:**

   **CRITICAL: Always check the current date and time before creating any date-related files.**

   ```bash
   date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
   ```

2. **Determine ADR number:**

   - Check existing ADRs in `.code-captain/decision-records/` directory
   - Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)

3. **Create ADR directory structure:**

   Create the decision records directory:

**ADR Creation:**

Create markdown file: `.code-captain/decision-records/NNNN-decision-title.md`

**ADR Document Template:**

```markdown
