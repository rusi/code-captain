# Plan Product Command (plan-product)

## Overview

Generate comprehensive product planning documentation using a contract-first approach that establishes clear product vision, mission, and roadmap before creating any supporting files. This command eliminates assumptions by gathering complete product context through structured discovery, then creates a complete product planning package for AI-assisted development.

## Command Process

### Phase 1: Product Discovery & Contract Establishment (No File Creation)

**Mission Statement:**
> Your goal is to transform a rough product idea into a comprehensive, actionable product plan. You will deliver the complete product planning package only after we both agree on the product contract. **Important: Challenge ideas that don't make business or technical sense - it's better to surface concerns early than build the wrong product.**

#### Step 1.1: Initial Context Scan

- Scan existing `.code-captain/product/` for any existing product documentation
- Load available project context from `.code-captain/docs/` (tech-stack.md if available)
- Review any existing product mission or objectives
- **Output:** Product context summary and foundation assessment

#### Step 1.2: Gap Analysis & Silent Enumeration

**Internal Process (not shown to user):**
- Silently list every missing product detail and requirement
- Identify ambiguities in the initial product description
- Note potential market and technical constraints
- Catalog unknowns across these domains:
  - Product vision and core value proposition
  - Target market and user personas
  - Key features and functionality scope
  - Business model and monetization strategy
  - Technical feasibility and architecture requirements
  - Competitive landscape and differentiation
  - Success metrics and validation criteria
  - Timeline expectations and resource constraints
  - Risk factors and mitigation strategies

#### Step 1.3: Structured Product Discovery Loop

**Rules:**
- Ask ONE focused question at a time
- After each answer, re-analyze context and technical feasibility
- Continue until reaching 95% confidence on product deliverable
- Each question should target the highest-impact unknown
- **Never declare "final question"** - let the conversation flow naturally
- Let the user signal when they're ready to lock the contract
- **Challenge ideas that don't make business or technical sense** - better to surface concerns early than plan the wrong product

**Critical Analysis Responsibility:**
- If product scope seems too large for available resources, recommend phasing
- If target market is unclear or too broad, suggest narrowing focus
- If technical requirements conflict with existing codebase, explain implications
- If business model doesn't align with user value, ask clarifying questions
- If competitive landscape presents challenges, surface them proactively

**Pushback Phrasing Examples:**
- "I see a potential issue with [scope] because [business/technical reason]. Would focusing on [core value] first work better?"
- "Based on your existing codebase, [proposed approach] might require significant architecture changes. Are you prepared for that?"
- "The market you're describing sounds very broad. Should we focus on [specific segment] to start?"
- "I'm concerned that [requirement] could face [specific challenge]. Have you considered [alternative approach]?"

**Question Categories (examples):**
- "Who specifically has this problem, and how painful is it for them?"
- "What would make someone switch from their current solution to yours?"
- "How will you measure product success in the first 6 months?"
- "What's your biggest constraint - time, budget, technical expertise, or market access?"
- "How does this align with your existing business/project goals?"
- "What happens if your first assumption about users turns out to be wrong?"

**Transition to Contract:**
- When confidence is high, present contract without declaring it "final"
- Use phrases like "I think I have enough to create a solid product contract" or "Based on our discussion, here's what I understand"
- Always leave room for more questions if needed

#### Step 1.4: Product Contract Proposal

When confident, present a product contract proposal with any concerns surfaced:

**Format:**
```

```

### Phase 2: Product Planning Package Creation (Post-Agreement Only)

**Triggered only after user confirms contract with 'yes'**

#### Step 2.1: Initialize Tracking

```bash
# Use todo_write to track creation process
1. Create product planning folder structure
2. Generate core product mission document
3. Develop product roadmap with phases
4. Create decision log and rationale
5. Generate lite mission for AI context
6. Present package for user review and validation
```

#### Step 2.2: Create Directory Structure

**Generated folder:**
```
